2.	The salesperson in New York should be transferred to Philadelphia to help boost sales and train the staff in these areas that are performing poorly.

# Conclusion: 
From the analysis I carried out, it is obvious that sales revenue for Luster Superstore always goes down in the first quarter and peaks in the fourth quarter again. So, the company is advised to always ensure that the measures used in the 2018 fourth quarter are sustained for the next 5 quarters.
For the future, the type of payment and method of payment should be included to remove any form of bias.
